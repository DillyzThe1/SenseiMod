# Sensei Role
This gamemode adds a NEW role to among us called the Sensei! Basically, you're a fast crewmate that zooms around the map when nobodys around. But whenever you want to, you can reveal your old sword ~~you bought for 14.99 yesterday~~! Be careful, as this can actually help the impostors if you going on a killing spree. You are supposed to be the crew's GUARD.
WARNING: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AMONG US 4.12s or 4.14s!
